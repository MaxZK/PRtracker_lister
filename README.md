# PRtracker_lister
This is a website tool to display more information about a round quickly.

## Features
* Display and round summary like a scoreboard with squad.
* Ties Battle Recorder and Tracker files together. (There is a slight rare chance of having a mismatch between a file)
* Search Maps, Layer, Game mode.
* Quickly shows Tickets and winners.
* Display server time. (More info about how to deal with it bellow)

## Exemple
* [Free Candy Van](http://pr.bluedrake42.com/pr/1/tracker/?srv=1)
* [BASSED](http://eu.databased.eu/pr/1/demo_tracker/index.php?srv=1)

## To Do
* Ability to search players that participated in a round.
* Total score of squads and teams in the summary display.
* Make the server time less shit to deal with.

## Some issues
* Tool is made on a old version of PHP, so you might have some issue with the arrays.
* If you don't want a site/voice button you need to manually remove the line 253 and/or 254.
* Can't easily edit the server time, go to line 263 to 265. I use this site to make the clock: [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/clocks/free.html)
